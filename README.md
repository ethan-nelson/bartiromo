This is a web application designed to assist in crowdsourced filtering and identification of features. The current focus is on weather and climate systems, but it can be applied to other situations as well.

Installation
============

It is ideal to use a Python virtual environment to maintain a consistent library environment. Additionally, pip can be used to install all the required libraries with one command. Thus, once the repository has been cloned or downloaded and you have navigated into the directory:

~~~
virtualenv ./env
env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
env/bin/python site.py
~~~

Your site should now be running on your machine's IP address under port 5432!
